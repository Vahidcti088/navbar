   <h2>Albert Einstein</h2>
    <p>Albert Einstein was born on 14 March in the year 1879 in Württemberg, Germany. He was educated at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich. Einstein was a theoretical physicist who discovered and invented major theories of Physics. Albert Einstein received honorary doctorate degrees in science and philosophy. He got the Fellowships of all the leading scientific academies in the world. His works were recognized across the world and in 1921, Einstein won the prestigious Nobel Prize for Physics for his significant work on the photoelectric effect. Let us dig into Albert Einstein’s inventions.

     Some inventions and contributions of Einstein are Avogadro’s Number, Quantum Theory of Light, General Theory of Relativity, Special Theory of Relativity, The Photoelectric Effect, Wave-Particle Duality, Brownian movement, the relationship between mass and energy, Bose-Einstein Condensate, and many more.

   <h2>Avogadro’s Number</h2>
   <p> Avogadro’s number is a concept in chemistry that defines that the number of units in one mole of a substance is equal to 6.022140857×1023

      The Avogadro constant is named after the Italian scientist Amedeo Avogadro. It is the proportionality factor defined by Albert Einstein to relate the number of constituent particles like molecules, ions, and atoms in a sample with the amount of substance in that sample. The numeric value of the Avogadro constant is expressed as the reciprocal of mole.
    
       When Einstein was working on Brownian motion to explain the erratic movement of particles in a fluid, he came up with an expression for the quantity of Avogadro’s number in terms of measurable quantities. This leads to a path to determine the mass of an atom, or the molar mass for each element on the periodic table. Albert Einstein presented a new way of calculating Avogadro’s number and the size of molecules
