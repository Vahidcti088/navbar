      <h2>Book Review — Einstein: The Man And His Mind</h2>
      <p>Science books aren’t generally seasonal. Readers don’t need to know about, say, “forever chemicals” or Homo Naledi in advance of Thanksgiving or the 4th of July more than they do at any other time of year. This means that, as a reviewer of science books, I have not ever started an article with the classic phrase ,“Just in time for Christmas.”

        Here goes.
        
        Just in time for Christmas comes an enormous (4.4 pounds, 10 x 1.25 x 13 inches), beautiful coffee table book about Albert Einstein, his private life, and his many theories, some world-changing, some early busts. I’ve already decided to whom I will give my copy this Christmas, and I’m going to have to lug the thing on a long train ride to do so. I will do so gladly, that’s how gorgeous and effective I think the book is.
        
        The book in question is Einstein: The Man and his Mind. Written for non-scientists, it consists of autographed photos, papers, articles, and quotes as collected by Gregory S. Berger, MD, and kept in lis private collection in Chapel Hill, NC. Dr. Berger wrote the book in concert with Michael DiRuggiero, the owner of the Manhattan Rare Book Company, which DiRuggiero co-founded and where he specializes in books about the history of science and, in particular, about Albert Einstein. Hanoch Gutfreund, the Andre Aisenstadt Chair in theoretical physics and past president at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, contributed the book’s Forward. (Einstein was one of the founding fathers at the university. All royalties from the book will be donated to the university’s Albert Einstein Archives.) Significant credit for this book also belongs to book designer Yolanda Cuomo, an American artist who has, over the years, collaborated with Richard Avedon, Paul Simon, Laurie Anderson, Twyla Tharp, and many others including the estate of Diane Arbus. Her design and execution of the physical book is simultaneously respectful and emotionally and intellectually moving.
